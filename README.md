Connected Autonomous Vehicles Situational Awareness Research Group

Through parallelization, our project can test multiple scenarios of a Connected Autonomous Vehicle in a simulation with human-driven vehicles and compare the risk level of assessment to successfully merge onto the highway.

**Materials**
SUMO
Webots
Palmetto Cluster

**Parameters**
-Speed
-X and Z Coordinate Position
-Bearing
-Merge Status (calculated field)
